## About this project

Mail Shark is an industry leading direct mail and marketing company. The sales team at Mail Shark often uses return on investment calculations to explain why direct mail is a great marketing tool. This calculation not only takes into account the customer’s average sale and mailing quantity, but also retention rates and referrals. This extra calculation is effective at convincing customers to enroll in a mailing campaign.

Previously, this ROI calculation was done behind the scenes with a private spreadsheet, providing very little transparency to customers. In an effort to make this sales tool more accessible, I was tasked to create an online version of the ROI calculator targeted towards automotive shop owners.

## Planning

### Stakeholder meeting

The stakeholder meeting involved the Regional Vice President of Sales, the Vice President of Marketing, the Creative Director and myself. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the goals, features, and tone of the project.

#### Goals

1. Allow the user to effortlessly calculate their potential direct mail ROI
2. Educate the user about the unseen, substantial long-term benefits of direct mail
3. Collect the user’s contact information for follow-up calls
